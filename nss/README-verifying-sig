Notes:
-----

Mozilla software is normally signed by the "Mozilla Software Releases" key
(e.g. Firefox).  The current release is signed by "Kai Engert", a member
of the NSS development team.

Excerpt from an email I received from Kai Engert" to check this:

...
yes, NSS isn't signed using a Mozilla key. NSS code used not to be
signed at all. It's not Mozilla who owns the NSS release process. NSS
releases are being produced by the NSS team. I'm a member of that team
and I often work on the release process.

If you would like to verify that I'm a member of the release team, you
could search the web for my activity related to NSS,
https://www.google.de/search?q=kai+engert+nss+release

My recent key has been signed by my older key, which in turn has been
signed by several other people (including even Werner Koch), so you
could have some confidence that my key belongs to my identity.

If you check the NSS download directories for the older releases, you'll
notice that they didn't contain any signatures at all. I had decided on
my own that starting to sign with at least my own key is better than
nothing.
